<H1>The Treaty Contract Framework</H1>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><A NAME="cuaj2"></A>Treaty is a pluggable contract framework for
arbitrary component models. Contracts between components describe the
responsibilities of collaborating components. A good example for this
is the collaboration between one component that has a (Java)
interface and another component that has to supply an implementation
class for this interface. Many component systems, including Eclipse,
have some onboard support for this kind of contract. However, there
are other kinds of contracts. For instance, a component may provide
an XML Schema and expects other components to supply an instance of
this schema. Or it has requirements with respect to the semantics of
methods implemented in a class that can be expressed with sets of
pre- and post conditions (in the tradition of design-by-contract).
Yet another example are quality of service contracts, for instance
constraints w.r.t. time and memory consumed by a component providing
a service.</P>
<P><B>Treaty  can be used to express these constraints as precise
contracts, and to verify component assemblies against these
contracts.</B>
