<H1>Treaty for Eclipse</H1>
<P><A NAME="cuaj4"></A>Treaty for Eclipse is an implementation of
Treaty for Eclipse. It contains the implementation of several Treaty
framework interfaces, mainly to load resources from plugins and to
read plugin meta-data (plugin.xml). Contract building blocks are
provided by plugins extending a vocabulary contribution extension
point in the Treaty for Eclipse plugin. Also included is a view to
browse all contracts found in the current Eclipse instance, and an
action to trigger verification of these contracts. Finally, a clock
sample application is provided that uses complex and polymorphic
contracts.
