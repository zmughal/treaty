<H1>The Treaty Contract Language</H1>
<P><A NAME="cuaj3"></A>Treaty defines a contract language that allows
to express constraints in a rather simple XML file that can be
attached to components as XML file in the META-INF folder. Treaty
also contains facilities to check these contracts for sets of
components (verification). Treaty is open w.r.t. the kinds of
contracts that can be expressed. The contract building blocks (types,
relationships and properties) can be supplied using components of the
underlying component model (see below for an example).
