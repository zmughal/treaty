<P><A NAME="cuaj2"></A>Treaty is a pluggable contract framework for
arbitrary component models. Contracts between components describe the
responsibilities of collaborating components. A good example for this
is the collaboration between one component that has a (Java)
interface and another component that has to supply an implementation
class for this interface. Many component systems, including Eclipse,
have on board support for this kind of contract. However, there are
other kinds of contracts. For instance, a component may provide an
XML Schema and expects other components to supply an instance of this
schema. Or it has requirements with respect to the semantics of
methods implemented in a class that can be expressed with sets of
pre- and post conditions (in the tradition of design-by-contract).
Yet another example are quality of service contracts, for instance
constraints w.r.t. time and memory consumed by a component providing
a service.</P>
