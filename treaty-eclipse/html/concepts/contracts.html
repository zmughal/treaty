<H1>The Treaty Contract Language</H1>
<P><A NAME="cuaj3"></A>Treaty defines a contract language that allows
to express all these contracts in a rather simple XML file that can
be attached to components. Treaty also contains facilities to check
these contracts for sets of components (verification). Treaty is open
w.r.t. the kinds of contracts that can be expressed. The contract
building blocks (types, relationships and properties) can be supplied
using components of the underlying component model (see below for an
example).
