      Treaty is a contract framework for arbitrary component models. The Treaty for Eclipse feature contains adapters for Eclipse plugins/OSGi bundles, views to show contracts between plugins (bundles) and installed contract vocabularies, and actions to check these contracts and verify the installed plugins.
Treaty for Eclipse also contains an example application that uses complex contracts to describe the relationships of plugins consuming and providing services.
