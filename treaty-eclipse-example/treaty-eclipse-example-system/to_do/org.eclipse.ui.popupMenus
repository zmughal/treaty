org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus.contract

when verifying current contract that has 2 suppliers (not allowed)
the contract verifies against treaty.xsd (should not be happening)

TO_DO: need to resolve how to use <context> in this contract, since it implements 
	2 different extension types that both have similar attributes,
	not sure how to choose which one to iterate over and which one to ignore.
