<P><A NAME="hce7"></A><A NAME="hce70"></A>The contract browser view
can be used to explore the structure of contracts and their
instantiations. A contract instantiation is a contract where the
extension point has been bound. That is, the resource references have
been resolved and now point to resources provided by a plugin with
the respective extension point. Sometimes, some resources can not be
bound. For instance, in the clock example a plugin has to provide
either a Java class or an XML instance (to format dates), not
both.<BR><BR>The contract browser has a verification function that
can be used to check the contracts. In the contract browser view, the
verification results will be displayed in the second column. Note
that for some of the date format plugins verification fails (on
purpose): some plugins either have the incorrect semantics (by
providing string that are too short) or are too slow and fail the
quality of service tests.
