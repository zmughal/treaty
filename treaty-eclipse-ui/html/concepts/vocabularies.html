<H1>Vocabularies</H1>
<P><A NAME="c_mi"></A><A NAME="c_mi1"></A><A NAME="c_mi0"></A>The
resource types and relationships are defined in a contract
vocabulary. The vocabulary is not static but dynamic. It is assembled
at runtime from plugins that contribute vocabularies. The respective
extension point in the Treaty for Eclipse plugin is
<B>net.java.treaty.eclipse.vocabulary</B>. Plugins extending this
extension point have to provide the following:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P><A NAME="c_mi3"></A><A NAME="c_mi2"></A>A list of contributed
	resource types 
	</P>
	<LI><P><A NAME="c_mi4"></A><A NAME="c_mi5"></A>A list of contributed
	relationship and property types</P>
	<LI><P><A NAME="c_mi6"></A>A method that can be used to find out
	whether two resources instantiate a contributed relationship 
	</P>
</OL>
<P><BR>The last part defines the semantics of the relationship. For
the relationships used in the clock example, plugins use tools such
as the Java reflection API, JUnit and validating XML parsers to
compute this information.<BR><BR>Extensions must provide an
implementation of the <B>net.java.treaty.ContractVocabulary</B>
interface and describe the contributed vocabulary elements through a
ontology (OWL file). The vocabulary view collects all these
vocabulary contributions, merges them into one ontology and displays
the elements in an Eclipse view. The merged ontology is also
available to plugins (for instance, to take advantage of ontology
reasoning) through the singleton class
<B>net.java.treaty.eclipse.Vocabulary</B>. The ontology is available
as unparsed text (string), and as parsed in memory representation as
instance of <B>org.semanticweb.owl.model.OWLOntology</B>.</P>
